## Installation

To run these games and experiments, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The `turtle` module is included with Python, so no additional installation is required. Simply clone this repository and navigate to the directory of the game you'd like to play.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jo53150/Playing_with_Turtle.git
cd Playing_with_Turtle
```

## Games Included

### Pong

A simple implementation of the classic Pong game. Two players can play against each other, using the keyboard to control the paddles.

- **Controls**:
  - Player 1 (Left Paddle): `W` (Up), `S` (Down)
  - Player 2 (Right Paddle): `Up Arrow` (Up), `Down Arrow` (Down)

### Snake Game

An implementation of the classic Snake game. Control the snake to eat food and grow longer, but avoid running into yourself or the walls.

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to move the snake.

### Etch A Sketch

A digital version of the classic Etch A Sketch toy. Use the arrow keys to draw on the screen, and press `C` to clear the drawing.

- **Controls**:
  - Arrow keys to move the cursor
  - `C` to clear the screen

### Turtle Race

A simple turtle race game where you can bet on which turtle will win. The turtles race across the screen, and the first to cross the finish line wins.

- **How to Play**: Run the script and enter your bet when prompted. The race will begin, and youâ€™ll see if your turtle wins!

## Usage

To play any of these games, simply navigate to the directory containing the game's script and run it using Python:

```bash
python pong.py
```

Replace `pong.py` with the name of the script you wish to run, such as `snake.py`, `etch_a_sketch.py`, or `turtle_race.py`.
